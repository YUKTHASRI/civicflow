# civicflow
CivicFlow is a full-stack web application built using React and Supabase, designed to help citizens report local civic issues (like potholes, garbage, water leakage) and enable authorities to manage and resolve those issues effectively.

It supports role-based access for:

Citizens – who submit complaints
Authorities – who view, prioritize, and resolve complaints
